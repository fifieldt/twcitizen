						<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Taiwanese nationality is based on the principle of <em>jus sanguinis</em> - passed on by blood.
If one or both of your parents are Taiwanese nationals it is very likely you are too, automatically.</p>
<p>However, there is an important conceptual difference in Taiwanese citizenship compared to that of other countries.
Essentially, Taiwan only has the concept of a &ldquo;national&rdquo;, and what most of us think of as the rights of
a citizen are tied with what is known as &ldquo;Household Registration&rdquo;. Nationals with full residence and
voting rights are known as &ldquo;Nationals with Household Registration&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are many Taiwanese nationals living overseas, who may be unaware they are Taiwanese, because they
do not have the right to live or work in Taiwan without taking some additional steps. These are known as
&ldquo;Nationals without Household Registration&rdquo; (NWOHR). NWOHR&rsquo;s can have Taiwan passports, but they lack
a national ID number (which significantly reduces the usefulness of the passport).</p>
<p>If you have Taiwanese parents and want to acquire Taiwanese citizenship, the first step you need to take
is to determine whether they ever held Household Registration. Try and find that document and bring it
to your local Taiwanese diplomatic post, who can provide advice on how to proceed.</p>
<p>There are many nuances here, including which of your parents was Taiwanese and when and where you were born.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>On January 1, 2024, the law that underpins citizenship for those with Taiwanese parents was amended. It is now much be easier to acquire citizenship than in the past! Be aware of outdated information.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="process-overview">Process overview</h2>
<p>Generally, there are four steps involved in acquiring Taiwanese citizenship for those with Taiwanese parents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Applying for a Taiwan (NWOHR) passport from your local Taiwanese embassy</li>
<li>Enter Taiwan using your Taiwan (NWOHR) passport</li>
<li>(sometimes) Apply for a Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC) and live in Taiwan for 1-5 years</li>
<li>Register a Household Registration (定居) to become a full citizen</li>
</ol>
<p>What documents you will need at each step, and whether you need to live in Taiwan for a period before
getting your Taiwanese ID will depend on your age and the status of your parents.</p>
<h2 id="information-for-minors">Information for Minors</h2>
<p>If you are under 18 years old, and your parents have active Household Registrations,
you may follow a simpler process. You will not have to apply for a
Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC) and may proceed directly to Household Registration.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/141948/">Instructions in English</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5385/7244/7250/7281/%E5%AE%9A%E5%B1%85/36430/">Instructions in Chinese</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As of January 1, 2024, if you were adopted by Taiwanese citizens you may also apply for
citizenship.</p>
<p>As a child, if your parents have an active household registration, you can even skip the step of
applying for a NWOHR passport overseas and enter Taiwan on your foreign passport. You
will still be allowed to perform Household Registration.</p>
<h2 id="applying-for-a-taiwan-nwohr-passport">Applying for a Taiwan (NWOHR) passport</h2>
<p>You can apply for a Taiwan passport at your local Taiwanese diplomatic mission.
In addition to your passport photos, you will likely need some of the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your home country passport</li>
<li>Your birth certificate</li>
<li>You parent&rsquo;s marriage certificate</li>
<li>Your parent&rsquo;s household registration, ID card, passport and/or birth certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these documents from a country other than Taiwan need to be translated to Chinese and certified by the
Taiwanese diplomatic mission responsible for the area where the document was produced.
For example, if you were born in Los Angeles, USA; then the TECO in Los Angeles needs to certify your
birth certificate.</p>
<h2 id="direct-to-household-registration-new-in-2024">Direct to Household Registration (New in 2024)</h2>
<p>As of January 1, 2024, if you meet either of the following conditions you can simply
enter Taiwan on your NWOHR Passport and become a full citizen.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you were born in Taiwan to Taiwanese parents with Household Registration but didn&rsquo;t get registered before you left the country</li>
<li>If you were born overseas and at least one of your parents has Household Registration.</li>
</ol>
<p>You only need to hold a Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC) temporarily, and be in Taiwan while your
application is processed. Visit NIA to apply for your TARC then take it to your Household Registration Office for immediate
registration. It&rsquo;ll take about 10 days to get the national ID and 10 days more for your full Taiwan passport.
You must use your Taiwan passport to exit the country.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-taiwan-area-residence-certificate-tarc">About the Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC)</h2>
<p>If you are a National without Household Registration (NWOHR) seeking full citizenship, you must apply for a TARC and
reside in Taiwan for:</p>
<ul>
<li>one year, for at least 335 days</li>
<li>two years, for more than 270 days a year</li>
<li>five years, for more than 183 days a year
prior to being able to apply for Household Registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions are available <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5385/7244/7250/7281/%E5%AE%9A%E5%B1%85/36430">in Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/141954/cp_news">in English</a>,
but be prepared to provide a translated and certified criminal background check from your home country and
a health check (done in Taiwan).</p>
<p>Unusually, you must provide a reason for applying for a TARC. The list of reasons
and associated document requirements <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/media/103476/0303-guidelines-for-the-application-for-residence-extension-of-residence-and-change-of-residence-reasons-for-nationals-without-registered-permanent-residence-in-the-taiwan-area.pdf#page=8">are here</a>.</p>
<p>You can skip getting a TARC if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have a parent with an active Household Registration</li>
<li>you were born in Taiwan to parents with Household Registration, but weren&rsquo;t registered before leaving the country</li>
<li>you are descended from a Taiwanese soldier stranded in Thailand or Burma after the civil war (AF391)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-methods-for-nwohrs-to-get-a-tarc">Common Methods for NWOHRs to get a TARC</h2>
<p>There are around twenty <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/media/103476/0303-guidelines-for-the-application-for-residence-extension-of-residence-and-change-of-residence-reasons-for-nationals-without-registered-permanent-residence-in-the-taiwan-area.pdf#page=8">different reasons</a>
a National without Household Registration
may apply for a Taiwan Area Residence Certificate, so they can stay in Taiwan
for the required number of days and subsequently become a full citizen. The most
common rely on submitting copies of blood relative&rsquo;s Household Registration documents.</p>
<p>AF351-AF354 are used where you are related to someone who currently has active household
registration in Taiwan. You&rsquo;ll just need the national ID of your relative and their
original (and a copy) 戶口名簿 or a less-than-3-month-old 戶籍謄本 and other documents
to prove your relationship. AF351 and AF352 are where it&rsquo;s your spouse and you&rsquo;ve been married less than/more than 4 years and don&rsquo;t have/have children. AF353 is where you have lineal relatives (i.e. parent, grandparent or great-grandparent)
who have an active household registration in Taiwan. AF354 is where
you have brothers, sisters or your spouse&rsquo;s parents with household registration.</p>
<p>AF384 is for NWOHRs over 20 years old who were born overseas, but whose parents have or
had household registration in Taiwan. Usually used when the household registration has
lapsed and/or parents are deceased, otherwise AF353 may be more straightforward.
You&rsquo;ll need a certified Chinese translation of your
birth certificate, a copy of your parents marriage registration, as well as copies of your
parent&rsquo;s Taiwan ID cards and the original 戶口名簿 and a copy. If your parents weren&rsquo;t
married when you were born, there are workarounds but it&rsquo;s best to ask your local embassy.</p>
<p>When applying under AF384 you may be told that this is only for applicants whose parents
are deceased, or be told that your parents should simply re-activate their household
registration if alive (i.e. to apply under AF353). However, this is not technically
required and with significant effort can be worked around with techniques such as an
affidavit that your parents are unable to travel.</p>
<p>Other common methods to get a TARC are - investing 10 million NT (AF358),
or getting a job in Taiwan that sponsors your work permit (AF370).</p>
